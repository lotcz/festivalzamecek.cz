Piwigo Bootstrap Darkroom
-------------------
A mobile-ready Piwigo theme based on [Bootstrap Default](https://github.com/Philio/bootstrapdefault) by Phil Bayfield.

### Features

* Choose color themes from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com), or use the included dark color scheme based on Lightroom's colors (default).
* Configurable carousel album navigation on the picture page using [slick slider](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)
* Full screen slideshow view using [PhotoSwipe](http://photoswipe.com)
 * Auto play support (replaces Piwigo default slideshow)
 * Album thumbnails can be linked to PhotoSwipe directly (like smartpocket)
 * Video support inside the slideshow modal
* Video support on Picture page using native HTML 5 video widget
* 100% mobile ready
 * fully responsive Navbars, Carousel, PhotoSwipe slideshow, video content
 * async/ondemand loading of carousel & PhotoSwipe content, adaptive image size selection, swipe & tap events
 

### Usage

1. Installation. Use one of:
 * Git clone and move to piwigo/themes/bootstrap_darkroom
 * Download from http://piwigo.org/ext/extension_view.php?eid=831
 * Or just use the Extension Manager
2. Enable Bootstrap Darkroom
3. To use it as the standard theme for mobile devices, you need to disable the Smartpocket theme (if enabled). In combination with the recommended plugins and by setting "Thumbnail link target" to "PhotoSwipe" or "PhotoSwipe (mobile devices only)" it will behave like smartpocket (click on thumbnail opens the slideshow, masonry style thumbnail page with ajax loading).

### Recommended Plugins
* [GThumb+](http://piwigo.org/ext/extension_view.php?eid=591) or [gdThumb](http://piwigo.org/ext/extension_view.php?eid=771): this will give you masonry-style thumbnail page.
* [RV Thumbnail Scroller](http://piwigo.org/ext/extension_view.php?eid=493): this one will load items on the thumbnails page as they are requested using ajax. HIGHLY recommended for mobile devices.

### Known issues

* The secondary navbar on the picture page might span several lines, depending on the length of the category/picture name. As a workaround, the number of nested levels is truncated to max 2 levels by default.
* On iOS the PhotoSwipe fullscreen mode isn't supported. On iPhone it does work in landscape orientation only, on iPad it doesn't work at all. That's an iOS bug. Works just fine on Android
* Plugins that add buttons to the Navbar might not (yet) be supported, see [Plugin Support Matrix](https://github.com/tkuther/piwigo-bootstrap-darkroom/wiki/Plugin-Support-Matrix)
* The Sidebar, if enabled in settings, doesn't play well with Bootswatch Themes. You need to CSS-style the sidebar yourself.
